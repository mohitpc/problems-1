At SharpStar we make predictions then you decide if the final outcome will be higher or lower, more or less, faster or slower.

If you think our quote is too low, you would BUY (higher figure).If you think we are too high, you would SELL (lower figure).The more right you are, the more you win – the more wrong you are, the more you lose.<p></div>

										<div class="panel-body content_wrap"><p>n fixed odds betting you are betting on particular outcome - it is a simple win, lose or push.Spread betting relies more than just the outcome, but your payout is dependant on how right you are or how wrong you are - and your stake size.

										<div class="panel-body content_wrap"><p>Our predictions are always in the form of two prices, a BUY (higher figure) price and a SELL price (lower figure).The range between the two prices is known as the spread.
For example: Dynamo Kiev vs Watford Total Goals market.The spread is 2.4 - 2.6 so if you think there will be less than 2.4 goals you’d SELL at 2.4.If you think there’ll be more than 2.6 goals then you’d BUY at 2.6.<p></div>

										<div class="panel-body content_wrap"><p>Let’s say you placed this bet: 
										Selection: Dynamo Kiev vs Watford
										Market: Total Goals
										Bet: BUY @2.6 with CNY100 Stake
										Result: 6 Total Goals
										This is how you’d work it out: 
										Total Goals (6) - BUY price (2.6) = Difference (3.4) 
										Difference (3.4) x Stake (CNY100) = CNY340 PROFIT
										But, let’s say there was only 2 goals scored, then….
										Total Goals (2) - BUY price (2.6) = Difference (0.6) 
										Difference (0.6) x Stake (CNY100) = CNY60 LOSS
