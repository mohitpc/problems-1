  <h1 class="mb10">RISK NOTICE</h1>
  <p>Spread betting involves a high level of risk to your capital as prices may move rapidly. It is possible that you could
    lose more than your original stake and that you may be required to make further payments. Spread betting is not suitable
    for everyone and it is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the nature of spread betting, the risks involved
    and the true extent of your exposure to the risk of loss. Your profit and loss will vary according to the extent of the
    fluctuations of the underlying markets on which your bet is based. You should only bet with money you can afford to lose.<br>You
    should remember that spread betting is different to other forms of betting:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The more accurate your prediction, the more you win and vice versa.</li>
    <li>You can close bets or open new ones at any time during live events.</li>
    <li>You can back teams or individuals to perform well or badly.</li>
    <li>You can win, or lose, large multiples of your stake.</li>
  </ol>
