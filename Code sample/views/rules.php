  <h1 class="mb15">Betting Rules</h1>
  <p>All bets you place with SharpStar are governed by our Betting Rules. These rules outline our acceptance and settlement
    criteria for general sports markets.&nbsp; Individual sports rules contain conditions specific to that individual sport
    and in the event that there is a contradiction between both rules, the individual sports rule shall take precedence.</p>
  <p>It is the responsibility of the client to ensure they are aware of rules, conditions and stipulations attached to markets
    offered.&nbsp; SharpStar staff will be happy to assist with any queries clients may have.&nbsp; Information is supplied
    in good faith and SharpStar will accept no liability for misinterpretation of information given or any inaccuracy of
    said information.</p>
  <ol class="outer_list">
    <li>
      <strong>General Sports Rules</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Placing  bets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Bets are placed on future events. Any bet placed on any event where the result can already be known at the time
              of placing the bet whether open or closed can be voided at our absolute discretion.&nbsp; This is regardless
              of whether or not the result was known to the client at the time of placing the bet.&nbsp; With regard to ‘so
              fars’; any bet placed on an incorrect ‘so far’ will be re-rated to reflect the correct ‘so far’ and ensure
              the bet is a bet placed on ‘the future’.&nbsp; For example, on a soccer match traded live in-running, you place
              a buy of RMB10 on corners at 11 with a ‘so far’ of 6.&nbsp; The ‘so far’ in fact at the time of placing the
              bet was 7. Your bet was placed at 11 on a so far of 6, needing another 5 corners to break even.&nbsp; Your
              bet would be re-rated to a buy at 12 to reflect the so far of 7, still needing 5 corners to break even.&nbsp;
              In essence, this is exactly the same bet, but reflects a bet on ‘the future’.&nbsp; This is of course subject
              to our discretion to void any bet made on the basis of incorrect information.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Participation  after placing a bet</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Events  must take place for a bet to stand.</strong></li>
            <li>If an event doesn’t take place, all bets on the event open or closed shall be voided.</li>
            <li>In an event which has begun, but there is no further play following the placement of the bet, all bets whether
              open or closed shall be void.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Abandoned events</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Markets  traded in-running or at intervals:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Where the result of the market is known at the time of abandonment the market will be settled on the basis
                  of that result.</li>
                <li>Where the result is not known but there is a tradeable quote when play ceases, settlement will be made at
                  the midpoint of the quote.</li>
                <li>Where there is no tradeable quote when play ceases any bet open or closed will be void.</li>
                <li>Where play is abandoned at an interval (for example, at half time) and the market is to be updated (and is
                  then updated), the first tradeable quote will be treated as the tradeable quote when play ceased for the
                  purposes of this condition.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Markets  not traded in-running:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>All bets will be void regardless of whether or not they have been settled.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Postponed events</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>All bets placed after the last completed action in any event will be void, whether open or closed.</li>
            <li>One day events:<strong> </strong>Where an event is completed on the day scheduled, even if later than scheduled
              all bets will be settled and the later finish time will not affect these settlements.&nbsp; Where an event
              is not completed within 24 hours of the scheduled completion day, all bets which have not made up (open or
              closed) shall be void. The exception is a market traded in-running or at intervals, in which case the market
              will be settled at the midpoint of the first updated tradeable quote following the last action to take place
              in the event.&nbsp; Where provision had been made in advance to complete a match at a later date in the event
              of rain or something else; this event will still be treated as having to be completed within one day.</li>
            <li>Events over two or more days: Where an event is scheduled to be completed over two or more days, but is not completed
              within three months of the completion date, all bets which have not made up (open or closed) shall be void.
              The exception is a market traded in-running or at intervals, in which case the market will be settled at the
              midpoint of the first updated tradeable quote following the last action to take place in the event in that
              three month period.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Participation/Non-Participation</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>All bets placed on a participant who takes no part in the event whether open or closed will be void.</li>
            <li>All bets placed on a participant who takes no further part in the event after the bet has been placed whether
              open or closed will be void. The exceptions to this are where the participant’s make-up can be affected by
              the performance of another participant who does take further part after the bet has been placed.&nbsp; Also,
              in the case of entertainment/other indices where a participant has been voted out or evicted, quotes will continue
              to be available to trade on up until the final result is known.</li>
            <li>Where a bet is placed on a participant who gets a walkover to the next round, that bet will be rebooked at the
              next tradeable price to reflect their progress.</li>
            <li>The withdrawal of a named participant from an event prior to the start of the event will result in bets on all
              other participants in the event being subject to deductions based on the price of the withdrawn participant
              at the time of their withdrawal. </li>
            <li>Name changes by participants which do not affect the event on which the market is based will not affect any bets
              on that market.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Curtailment of long-term markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>If a long term market has been curtailed and no further play is possible then all bets placed after last completed
              action whether open or closed, will be void.&nbsp; The following will apply to all other bets placed on the
              curtailed long term market:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>If an official result is declared, then markets will be settled on the official result;</li>
                <li>If there is no official result declared, then all bets still open will be settled at the midpoint of the
                  quote immediately after the last completed play of the tournament;</li>
                <li> Closed bets will stand.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Where further play is possible, for instance one team is ejected from a league or is unable to fulfil its remaining
              fixtures for whatever reason then the market is still considered curtailed as the league cannot continue as
              originally advertised.&nbsp; A change to the number of participants or games will result in the market being
              deemed to have been curtailed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again in this instance: All bets still open will be settled at the
              midpoint of the quote immediately after the last completed play of the tournament before the announcement of
              the change.&nbsp; Closed bets will stand.&nbsp; Any and all bets placed after last completed action before
              the announcement of the change whether open or closed, will be void.&nbsp; Once again, name changes to clubs
              arising from takeovers or mergers or whatever will not affect a long term market as long as the newly named
              club fulfil original fixture commitments.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disqualification</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>With the nature of sport and the markets we offer, from time to time one or more participants in a market will
              be disqualified.&nbsp; Should this happen there are a number of things to note; firstly, disqualification will
              be deemed to have taken place at the time the incident occurred that led to disqualification, not when the
              participant is removed from the competition. Secondly, the disqualified participant will finish ahead of any
              participant who was eliminated before their disqualification.&nbsp; Finally, regardless of their position at
              the time of disqualification, the disqualified participant will be deemed to have finished last of all the
              remaining participants still competing in the event.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Settling events</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Results
              <ol>
                <li>When settling a market the official result is final.&nbsp; We will use all publicly available information/evidence
                  to determine the official result.&nbsp; If no official result is available, we will ask an independent
                  authority to make a ruling on the result; their decision will be final.&nbsp; In the event that the independent
                  authority is unable to do so, we will determine the result, again by using all publicly available information/evidence.</li>
                <li>Bets may be provisionally settled after an event using all publicly available information/evidence.&nbsp;
                  If this settlement differs from the official result (once it is known), then the settlement may be adjusted
                  to reflect the official result.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Final settlement of events
              <ol>
                <li>For events scheduled to be completed in one day, markets will be settled within 3 days of the event end date.&nbsp;
                  For events scheduled to be completed in 2 or more days, markets will be settled as soon as possible after
                  the event has finished.&nbsp; No changes will be made to make-ups of markets after their final settlement.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time  related bets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>A bet on an event will have a time related factor.&nbsp; For example, a soccer match is 90 minutes and markets
              offered on a soccer match are offered on the basis of what happens in the 90 minutes.&nbsp; On these individual
              events, injury time will be included, but not extra time. The exceptions to this are certain American Sports
              (where overtime is needed to determine a result). These are covered in the rules for those Sports.</li>
            <li>Within these events there are time related markets, like the length of time until a specific thing occurs. Bets
              on these markets will be settled as if the specific thing happened at the end of the unit of time in which
              it occurred. For example, a goal scored after 31 minutes and 18 seconds will be deemed to have been scored
              in the 32nd minute. If an event occurs after scheduled time, it will still be deemed to have happened at the
              end of scheduled time.&nbsp; For example, a goal scored 3 minutes into injury time at the end of the first
              half will still be deemed to have been scored in the 45th minute. </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shirt  numbers – maximum and minimum</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Markets are offered in a variety of sports pertaining to competitor’s shirt numbers when the competitor achieves
              a desired result (for example, gets booked, scores a goal) In these markets, the maximum singular shirt number
              is 100. Any competitor wearing a number greater than 100 will be deemed to be wearing 100. The minimum shirt
              number is 0.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Markets  on groups of matches</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Markets will frequently be offered on a group of matches (for instance Total Goals on all weekend Premier League
              fixtures).&nbsp; Where we offer such markets, if 50% of the matches within the group aren’t completed, all
              bets are void.&nbsp; If one or more (but less than 50%) of the matches are cancelled or postponed, the price
              will be adjusted by the midpoint of the market at the time the match was postponed/cancelled.&nbsp; If a match
              within the group of matches is abandoned during play, the midpoint at the time of abandonment will be used.&nbsp;
              This will be the case, regardless of whether these matches are rescheduled.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stipulations  within markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>We will offer certain markets which have stipulations attached.&nbsp; If the stipulations attached to markets
              are not met then any bets on the market whether open or closed shall be void.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the responsibility
              of the client to ensure they are aware of stipulations attached to markets offered.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhanced  match betting</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Match bets will regularly be offered where points are awarded to the winner and bonus points are awarded for
              the margin of victory.&nbsp; However, with the exception of these, the maximum margin of victory will be as
              if one participant won every component of the match.&nbsp; If a player is disqualified or withdraws, settlement
              will be based on the same criteria as traditional match bets on the same sport.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that
              extra play is required to determine the winner (over the originally scheduled play – eg. penalty shoot-out
              in soccer) the winner will receive the points to be allocated for winning, but no bonus points.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Soccer</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Individual matches</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Unless otherwise stated, bets on individual matches are for the scheduled 90 minutes plus injury time only.&nbsp;
              Extra time markets may be introduced at the end of 90 minutes if necessary.&nbsp; If a match is moved to a
              different venue from that which was scheduled; all bets will stand unless the new venue is the ground of either
              team involved; in this case all bets whether open or closed will be void.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Goal times</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>In a goalless draw, the time of the first match goal will be settled at 90 and the time of the last match goal
              will be settled at 0. Where goals are scored, the goal times will be settled in accordance to the television
              broadcaster.&nbsp; If the game is not televised or if the game is covered by more than one broadcaster and
              they are in disagreement then the goal time will be settled in accordance with general sports rule ‘Settling
              events’</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Corner markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>The predicted number of corners taken by both teams in total. These markets are settled in accordance with the
              general sports rule ‘Settling events’.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-corners markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>A soccer spread market based on the prediction of the number of first half corners multiplied by the number of
              second half corners.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Total goals</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>This is a prediction on the total number of goals scored in a match or tournament.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bookings markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>These markets are settled in accordance with the general sports rule ‘Settling events’.&nbsp; Provisional settlement
              of bookings markets may occur after a match has ended and this can be altered if the official result differs
              provided the official result is available within the settlement timeframe laid out in general sports rule ‘Final
              settlement of events’.&nbsp; If a red card is rescinded or downgraded to yellow after the final whistle, this
              will not affect the settlement of any markets involving bookings.&nbsp; Only bookings of players who are on
              the field after the whistle to start the match and until they leave the pitch for the last time (half time
              is included) will count in any market involving bookings. Bookings received by players before the game has
              started, after the final whistle or after they have been substituted, do not count. Bookings of any non-playing
              member of a team will not count. The maximum points a player can receive is 35. A player receiving two yellows
              and a red will be deemed to have received one yellow and one red. A player shown a yellow card whilst not on
              the field who then comes on as a substitute, receives a second yellow and a red will be deemed to have received
              a red card only.&nbsp; Markets related to times of red or yellow cards will be settled at the time the card
              is shown, not the time the incident occurred leading to the card.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>For in-running matches, performance markets may be offered include match performance, team performances and team
              mini performances.&nbsp; The individual components of these markets will be determined by the rules set out
              here for each individual component (bookings, corners, etc).</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shirt numbers</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Where a market is offered on aggregate shirt numbers the following will apply:
              <ul>
                <li>If an own goal is scored, the shirt number will be awarded to the team who was awarded the goal.</li>
                <li>If a player is wearing a shirt with no number or a different number to the shirt they started (or came on
                  as substitute) with, the number of their original shirt will apply to any shirt number market.</li>
                <li>If a player starts a game or comes on as a substitute with a numberless shirt, they will be deemed to be
                  wearing number 12.</li>
                <li>In the event of doubt about a goalscorer, the opinion of the television broadcaster will be taken.&nbsp;
                  If there is disagreement within the broadcasting channel or if there is more than one broadcaster and they
                  contradict each other, or if the game isn’t televised then the scorer will be determined in accordance
                  with the general sports rule ‘Settling events’.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Player goal minutes</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Own goals do not count towards an individual player’s goal minutes.&nbsp; Again, in the event of doubt about
              a goalscorer, the opinion of the television broadcaster will be taken.&nbsp; If there is disagreement within
              the broadcasting channel or if there is more than one broadcaster and they contradict each other, or if the
              game isn’t televised then the scorer will be determined in accordance with the general sports rule ‘Settling
              events’.&nbsp; Any player goal minutes bets placed before the start of a match will be void if the player doesn’t
              start the match. The same applies to Player Goal Minutes (PGM) bets placed at half time if the player fails
              to start the second half.</li>

            <li>Markets on matches traded in-running:
              <ul>
                <li>Where the result of the market is known at the time of abandonment the market will be settled on the basis
                  of that result.</li>
                <li>Where the result is not known, but there is a tradeable quote when play ceases, settlement will be made at
                  the midpoint of the quote.</li>
                <li>Where there is no tradeable quote when play ceases any bet open or closed will be void.</li>
                <li>Where play is abandoned at an interval (for example, at half time) and the market is to be updated (and is
                  then updated), the first tradeable quote will be treated as the tradeable quote when play ceased for the
                  purposes of this condition. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Markets on matches not traded in-running:

          <strong>Divisional season points and indices</strong>

            <li>Only points gained on the field of play will count towards season total points. Any points deductions made from
              a team’s total will have no effect on season points, whether these are deducted before, during or after the
              season.&nbsp; A season index, whether championship or relegation, will be decided on a team’s final finishing
              position.&nbsp; Therefore points deductions (if any) will come into play.&nbsp; An appeal against a points
              deduction will be disregarded unless it has been settled before the final game in the division in question
              has been played.</li>

          <strong>Curtailment of long term markets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>If a long term market has been curtailed and no further play is possible then all bets placed after the last
              completed action whether open or closed will be void.&nbsp; The following will apply to all other bets placed
              on the curtailed long term market:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>If an official result is declared, then markets will be settled on the official result;</li>
                <li> If there is no official result declared, then all bets still open will be settled at the midpoint of the
                  quote immediately after the last completed play of the tournament;</li>
                <li> Closed bets will stand.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Where further play is possible, for instance one team is ejected from a league or is unable to fulfil its remaining
              fixtures for whatever reason then the market is still considered curtailed as the league cannot continue as
              originally advertised.&nbsp; A change to the number of participants or games will result in the market being
              deemed to have been curtailed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again in this instance:</li>
            <li>All bets still open will be settled at the midpoint of the quote immediately after the last completed play of
              the tournament before the announcement of the change.&nbsp; Closed bets will stand.&nbsp; Any and all bets
              placed after last completed action before the announcement of the change whether open or closed, will be void.&nbsp;
              Once again, name changes to clubs arising from takeovers or mergers or whatever will not affect a long term
              market as long as the newly named club fulfil original fixture commitments.</li>

          <strong>Limited Overs Matches - Innings Runs</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>In a limited overs match where a team’s innings runs is traded in-play and the innings is curtailed or subject to any reduction in overs, then the innings runs market will be settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced. If an innings becomes subject to a reduction, but resumes at a later time, a new market may be formed. If a client wants a position in the new market they are required to place a new trade. If there are any subsequent reductions in overs, exactly the same rules will continue to apply, i.e. the market is settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced and a new market may be formed. </li>
            <li>In the unlikely event that there is no tradable quote at the time when the innings is reduced, or if the market is not being traded in-play then all bets on the market open or closed shall be voided.</li>

          <strong>Limited Overs Matches - Innings Runs Bands </strong>
          <ol>
            <li>The result of this market is determined by the total number of runs scored by a team in the course of an innings.</li>
            <li>
              Innings runs bets will be void if there is insufficient play in the innings as follows: 
              <ol type="a">
                <li>In one day matches (other than Twenty20 matches) innings runs bets will be void if the scheduled number of overs for the innings is reduced by 5 or more overs after the bet is placed and the team is not all out and has not reached a target to win the match. </li>
                <li>In Twenty20 matches innings runs bets will be void if the scheduled number of overs for the innings is reduced by 3 or more overs after the bet is placed and the team is not all out and has not reached a target to win the match.</li>

          <strong>Limited Overs Matches - Individual Batsmen Runs/25 Ups/50 Ups/Partnerships </strong>
          <ol>
            <li>In a limited overs match where an individual batsman, 25 Ups, 50 Ups, or partnership runs are traded in-play and the innings is curtailed or subject to any reduction in overs, then these markets will be settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced. If the innings resumes at a later time, a new market may be formed. If a client wants a position in the new market they are required to place a new trade. If there are any subsequent reductions in overs, exactly the same rules will continue to apply i.e. the market is settled at the midpoint of the last available quote before the overs were reduced and a new market may be formed.</li>

            <li>If a batsman in the relevant partnership runs market retires hurt, the partnership is treated as continuing between the remaining batsman and the batsman who comes to the wicket. A partnership is treated as being ended by the end of an innings.</li>

            <li>
              A bet may be offered about the margin of victory in a match, awarding points for each run or wicket won by. The official result, in runs won by or wickets won by, will determine the make-up of the market where:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>the game is completed, even if the scheduled number of overs for either side is reduced; or</li>
                <li>the game is abandoned, but an official result is declared by reference to the Duckworth-Lewis method, or such other method as is being applied by the relevant authority, on the basis of whether or not an adjusted target has been attained. </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Where a game is abandoned with no official result:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>if the market is being traded in-play, the make-up will be the midpoint of the quote at the time at which play ceases; or</li>
                <li>if the market is not being traded in-play, all bets on the market open or closed shall be voided.</li>
                <li>In the event of a tie or a draw, supremacy bets will be settled at zero irrespective of the fact that a tie may result in one team progressing further in a competition.</li>

          <strong>Limited Overs Matches - Innings Increments </strong>
          <ol>
            <li>A bet may be offered about the number of runs scored in a certain stage of an innings e.g. first 15 overs in a 50 over match or the first 6 overs in a Twenty20 match. If the innings is abandoned prior to the completion of specified number of overs, the market will be settled at the midpoint of the quote at the time at which the innings is reduced.</li>
            <li>In the unlikely event that there is no tradable quote at the time when the innings is reduced, or if the market is not being traded in-play then all bets on the market open or closed shall be voided.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>Limited Overs Matches – Binary Bets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Bets will be settled on the official result. All bets on a match will be void if the match is officially declared as a ‘no result’. If a match is affected by external factors (such as bad weather) and is not declared as a ‘no result’, bets will be settled based on the official competition rule according to the event’s governing body (this includes matches where the result is determined by the Duckworth-Lewis method, or where the scheduled number of overs is reduced.) The Duckworth Lewis method is the system used to adjust the scores in the event of a delay (such as due to rain) during one-day matches, in order to leave the balance of the match unaltered. The system uses the number of overs each team have still to receive and the number of wickets they have in hand in order to determine a revised target or reach an official result.</li>
            <li>If the result of a one day or Twenty20 match is a tie, and no winner is declared by the official competition rules, then dead heat rules apply and both binaries will settle at 50. If a winner is declared by competition rules, for example a Super Over, most boundaries or previous results, then the winner of this will be deemed the winner of the match. This binary will settle at 100, with the losing team’s binary settling at 0.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Matches - Binary Bets</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>In the event of a tied Test Match or County Championship match (i.e. where all innings have been completed and both teams have the same score) the draw will be deemed a loser and settle at 0. Dead heat rules will apply to bets on each team for the outright result, meaning the Team to win Match markets will both settle at 50.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Matches - Innings Runs</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>All bets, open or closed, on a team’s innings runs shall be void if 50 full overs are not bowled unless one team has won, is dismissed or declares prior to that point.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Matches - Individual Batsmen Runs/Partnerships</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>All bets, open or closed, on an individual batsman or partnership runs shall be void if 50 full overs are not bowled unless one team has won, is dismissed or declares prior to that point. Bets on partnership totals make up when the next wicket falls. If a batsman in the relevant partnership retires hurt, the partnership is treated as continuing between the remaining batsman and the batsman who comes to the wicket. A partnership is also treated as being ended by the end of an innings.</li>

The only exception to this rule is if a match is abandoned following the team batting 2nd being bowled out (not declared) but before the start of the 3rd innings.</li>

          <strong>All Matches - Retired Batsmen &amp; Batsmen not Coming to the Crease</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Where a batsman retires and does not take the field again to bat in the same innings, his score for that innings will be settled at the number of runs he has scored. Batsman runs are often quoted on the assumption that he is coming into bat at that point. Where the batsman does not come out to bat and a price is quoted on a false assumption that he would, all bets during this period on this batsman’s runs will be voided.</li>

          <strong>All Matches - Markets Not Traded In-play</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>On certain matches we will offer a selection of markets which are not traded in-play. If there is an official result then all bets on these markets will stand. If there is no official result then bets will be void unless that market has already made up. Examples of such markets are wides; multi-wides; total sixes; multi-sixes; total fours; multi-fours etc. Super Overs do not count for these markets.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>All Matches – Adjustments</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Any subsequent official adjustments to the innings total runs or a batsman’s runs after the innings has finished will be included for the purposes of the relevant market. In the event of an adjustment being made to an innings, any bet placed after an adjustment may be re-booked to reflect the fact the bet was placed on an incorrect “so far”.</li>

                <li>If the maximum duration of a match is reduced (but not by reason of the disqualification or retirement of one of the players during the match, such scenario being dealt with in paragraph b below), e.g. from five sets to three sets, all bets (including supremacy, total games and set supremacy bets) whether open or closed shall be voided.</li>
                <li>Player retires or is disqualified during match traded in running: Where the match is traded in-running, the player’s retirement or disqualification will result in the game taken to be abandoned and the relevant in-running market will be dealt with and settled at the midpoint of the last available quote.</li>
                <li>Player retires or is disqualified during match not traded in-running: Any match not traded in-running during which a player retires or is disqualified will be settled according to Rule 1.3 under General Sports Rules – Abandoned events. </li>
                <li>All other markets will be void unless they have already made up, in which case it will be settled appropriately.</li>
                <li>In the event of a change to playing surface, venue or change from indoor court to outdoor and vice versa, all bets stand.</li>

          <strong>Match Bets Scheduled for 36 Holes or Less</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>If neither player completes one round, all bets open or closed, shall be void. In the event of a player's withdrawal or disqualification after teeing off in the event, a five stroke victory in the match will be awarded to whichever player has progressed further in the tournament, where progress is measured by full rounds completed. Where the bet concerns a match play tournament, the player whose opponent has withdrawn or been disqualified shall be treated as winning by five holes. In the event of both players withdrawing or being disqualified during the same round, all bets open or closed shall be void. Bets on a match involving a player who takes no further part in a tournament following the execution of the bet shall be void, whether open or closed. The maximum make-up in matches scheduled to take place over 36 holes or less is 15 shots. Extra holes (e.g. playoff holes) are irrelevant for the purposes of match bets, unless stated otherwise (see Rule 1.13 under General Sports Rules - Enhanced Match Betting). In an 18- hole match bet, any penalty or disqualification will only affect the settlement of a match bet relating to the round in which it occurs if it is announced before the player tees off in his next round.</li>

          <strong>Match Bets Scheduled for More Than 36 Holes </strong>
          <ol>
            <li>The same principles governing match bets over 36 holes or less will also apply to match bets over more than 36 holes, except that in the event of a player’s withdrawal or disqualification after teeing off in the event, a ten stroke victory in the match will be awarded to whichever player has progressed further in the tournament, where progress is measured by full rounds completed, provided the bet has not already been settled. The maximum make-up in matches scheduled to take place over more than 36 holes is 25 shots. Extra holes (e.g. playoff holes) are irrelevant for the purposes of match bets, unless stated otherwise (see Rule 1.13 under General Sports Rules - Enhanced Match Betting). In the event of either player missing the cut, both players' scores will be doubled at that stage (or adjusted, pro rata, where the number of rounds originally scheduled to be played is not four and/or where the cut takes place in a round other than the second round). Where a match bet has been settled at the cut stage, it is not affected in any way by the subsequent performance of a player who has made the cut, even in the event of his disqualification. For the avoidance of doubt, this rule will also apply to circumstances where the cut is re-defined after the start of the tournament, which may result in an unequal number of rounds being played by participants in a match bet.</li>

          <strong>Finishing Positions</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>A player will be deemed to have finished in the exact position that player finished in the field with a maximum make-up of 70. If a player tees off but subsequently withdraws, is disqualified, or retires prior to the cut then that player's finishing position will make up at 70, unless otherwise stated. If a player withdraws, is disqualified or retires after the cut then that player's finishing position makes up at the number of players who made the cut (with a maximum of 70). In the event of a player making the cut and not being allowed to participate in subsequent rounds for whatever reason (including officially making the cut), then that player's finishing position will be settled according to the official result under the ties rule (with a maximum of 70). Bets on a player who fails to tee off in his first round shall be void as will all bets, whether opening or closing, on a player who takes no further part in a tournament following the placing of the bet. If there is a tie, the market will be settled at the average finishing position of the tied players. For example, if 3 players tie for 10th position, the market will make up at 11 ((10+11+12)/3=11). However, if there is a playoff for first place, that playoff will only count for the purposes of determining the winner. No other ties will be split as a result of that playoff, i.e. in a three-way playoff the eventual winner's finishing position will be 1, and those of the other two will be 2.5 ((2+3)/2=2.5), regardless of when they were eliminated in the playoff. Where a market is offered on finishing positions with ‘no maximums’, a player will be deemed to have finished in the exact position that player finished in the field with a maximum make-up equal to the number of players in the field, with the same settlement rules for ties as above. If a player withdraws or is disqualified, that player will be deemed to finish last of those remaining in the tournament at the time of withdrawal, or that player at the time of the announcement of the disqualification.</li>

          <strong>Tournament Index</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>If a player quoted in a Tournament Index does not tee off for his first round, we will apply deductions to the prices of all other players (see Rule 1.5 under General Sports Rules - Participation/Non-Participation), based on the midpoint of that player's price at the beginning of the first round. A player who, having teed off, fails to complete a round, withdraws, or is disqualified, will be deemed to have finished last of the players in the index still playing in the tournament. A player who makes the two-round cut is always deemed to have beaten a player who misses the two-round cut, irrespective of his subsequent score. Playoffs will count to split ties for first place only (as in Golf 7.3.1). If one or more rounds have been completed and the prices have been updated, and a player takes no further part in a tournament owing to withdrawal or disqualification, all bets struck on that player at the updated prices whether open or closed shall be void. </li>

          <strong>Reduced Tournament</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>If a tournament is reduced in length then all markets on the tournament relating to the finishing order of the players will be settled by reference to the official result. The winning score and markets relating to the number of times certain events occur during the tournament will be adjusted pro rata. In the event of a player's withdrawal or disqualification in a reduced tournament, the number of strokes awarded to the winner of a match involving him will be based on the number of rounds originally scheduled, rather than the number of rounds completed. In the event of the cut being changed from the original set of conditions when a market was first advertised, the original conditions will apply for settlement for all markets. All players who made the original cut, but not the re-scheduled cut, will be deemed to have made the cut.</li>
